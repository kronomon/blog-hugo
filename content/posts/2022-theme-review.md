## Year of Adventure
At the start of this year, I was excited to spend some time away from the rat race. I had taken a voluntary work sabbatical to focus on my newborn.

I had a year of [exploration](/posts/2022-theme). ‚úàÔ∏è

## Goals
I had many goals during my time off work. There's finally time to start doing some side-projects that I've always wanted to do!

But, being a stay-at-home parent is truly a full-time job, especially at 6-18 months when their little minds are soaking in everything. My daughter needed a playmate to spar with, and I was that playmate.

Nonetheless, I was able to spend some time exploring. Here I'll reflect on what I strived to accomplish.

* **Explore Family:** Be present while my daughter's growing up ‚úÖ
    * Check! I'm super grateful to be with her at many firsts - "dada", crawling, walking.
    * I also love her "WOW" proclamations at everything new, and seeing her face light up when I make her smoothies
    * Even though it's draining, parenting is rewarding. It allows me to savour the little moments in life
* **Explore Business:** A [laser-cutting service](https://www.charreddesigns.ca) ‚úÖ
    * Charred Designs was born and we experimented alot this year üë®‚Äçüî¨
    * We went to 3 different craft fairs! _(It was a wild ride while RSV was circling our family but we survived)_
    * [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/CharredDesignsCA) is up with a grand total of 5 sales üòÜ
* **Explore Community:** Daddy and Me group for a community of dads focussed on family ‚úÖ
    * Didn't end up forming one, but I have a supportive friend group who are also new parents. Thankful for sharing stories and exchanging tips
    * Found my community through programs at community centers and neighbourhood family places. Great places to drop-in for kids AND parents to chat
* **Explore Creatively:** Self-publish an escape-room book ‚ùå
    * This one is put on the backburner. Still on the bucket list though!
    * With ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other AI tools popping up...maybe I could use them to help me with graphics... ü§î
* **Explore Passion:** Hone my teaching skills through blogging and video tutorials ‚ùå
    * Also on the backburner. Videos take so much more time than you think!
    * I did do a cybersecurity workshop to seniors...that was fun
* **Explore Literally:** At least one east-coast Canada trip and one international trip ‚úÖ
    * Lesson learnt: Travelling with a baby is AMBITIOUS. Applause for all the parents that do travel during their baby's first 2 years of life. 
    * We went to the east coast to visit a friend in St. John's, Newfoundland and stopped by Montreal to visit the Biodome
    * Highlights: reaching the most easternly point of Canada _(Cape Spear)_, partridgeberry jam, and Little Italy's potato pizza ü§§.

# Closing Thoughts
I'm happy with where the year's taken me. At first I was a bit nervous, losing the only structure I knew. But it was a refreshing change with more balance in my life.

Onto better and newer things for [2023](/posts/2023-theme)!
