### Hello friend. Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lamont, and welcome to my blog. No matter who you are, and how you found me, I'm happy you're here and I can say hi ðŸ™‚

In this post, I'll give a little background on myself and why I started this project.

# Why am I here?

I'm starting this blog mainly for two reasons.

1. I want to build a rapport online to build relationships with potential clients
2. I always had a passion to teach and this is a great outlet to share my struggles and learnings, in case it helps anyone else who's going through similar issues

# Background

I have 8 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worn many hats over that time. Some of the roles include:
* **DevOps Engineer** for Productivity *(Jenkins, GitLab, SonarQube)*
* **DevOps Engineer/SRE** for Infrastructure *(distributed systems such as CockroachDB, Kafka, and Pulsar)*
* **Full Stack Development** *(Python/Django, Perl, PHP)*
* **Release QA Engineer** *(testing, automation, bash, Perl, Python)*

When I started my first full-time role, I only had a couple of C++/Java courses under my belt. My major in Mechatronics Engineering did not fully prepare me for a pure software role, and many of my peers went into mechanical/systems engineering routes. But I'm glad I stuck with software and am forever thankful for the opportunity my first manager gave me.

Over the years, I've had a great experience learning from my peers and understanding how enterprise companies run.

However, for 2022 I want to try something different. Something new.

I quit.

# What's Next?

Last year I had a daughter. During my parental leave, I decided that it was the right time for me to take a sabbatical from work. 

While technically I am a stay-at-home dad and am focussing on family first, I've had a couple [projects in my mind](/posts/2022-theme) that I want to bring to life in the near future. I will be writing about my journey in hopes that it will help someone.

Otherwise, I am still open to consulting or freelance remote work, preferrably part-time to take care of my daughter.

# Why are you here?
So, what brings you here? Is there anything I can help with?

# Until next time
Thanks for reaching the end, mom! Stay tuned ðŸ™‚
