Hi there! Welcome to the first edition of my newsletter. Glad to have you here 👋

This has been a busy month. My last day at work was at the beginning of this month, and since then life has felt like a step function.

Before, I was mainly focussed on wrapping things up at work while my wife was focussed on the baby. Since I quit, the roles have been reversed as she's easing back into work and I'm caretaker during the workday.

Thank goodness for grandparents 🙏

# Updates 📘
* Launched a website for [Charred Designs](https://charreddesigns.ca)
* Started posting on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/charred.designs/) for Charred Designs after a long hiatus

# Lessons 📝
* It's really difficult to work on projects when taking care of baby due to constant context switching 😪
* [Facebook Business](https://business.facebook.com/) is a neat tool for scheduling Facebook/Instagram posts all in one interface
* All the packaging I've known from small-businesses basically come from ULINE! 🤯
  * Example: I see these [tin cans](https://www.uline.ca/BL_5648/Deep-Metal-Tins) everywhere when buying Christmas presents (ex. shaving cream, lotions). Now I know the packaging source 😆

# On My Mind 💡
As Jake says:
> Sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something

This is me sucking at something 🙌. Imperfect action is better than perfect inaction.

Is there anything you've been stuck not starting?

# Asks 🙇
* Do you know anyone who'd be interested in wedding or special events decor? I may be able to help!
  * ex. Wedding signs, name plates, cake toppers, etc.
