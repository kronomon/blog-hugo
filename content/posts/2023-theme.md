# New Year, New You üçæ
In 2022, I had a year of [Exploration](/posts/2022-theme). The overarching theme of adventure was helpful in guiding my decisions throughout the year.

This year, my theme is **Creativity**

# Creativity üñäÔ∏è

Building on top of last year's exploration into different areas of life besides software engineering, I want to create more this year.

I had two creative projects that were put in the backburner as well that I'd like to make some progress on.

## Goals ‚ú®
My goals in no particular order for this year:

* **Creative Opportunities:** Explore a creative source of income _(open to consulting, part-time, full-time, or other sources)_ 
* **Creative Business:** Continue [Charred Designs](https://www.charreddesigns.ca)
    * Learn branding, design principles, and revamp the website
    * Expand product lines and selling digital SVGs
* **Creative Hobbies:** Work on a Puzzle Book
    * Take a creative expression course _(drawing? writing?)_ üé®
* **Creative Health:** I want to get back into shape while enjoying time with baby
    * ex. Baby-and-me HIIT classes? Biking daytrip?

Stretch goals that my wife gave me:
* Cook something creative
* Plan a creatively themed bbq party for friends
* Start a new creative hobby _(suggestions: photography, writing, podcasting)_

# How about you? üßë
Do you have any creative plans?

Share them with me, I'd love to listen!
