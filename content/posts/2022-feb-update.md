Hello again!

I feel like it's only been a week since the last update. Oh how time flies. 🪁

This month, I've taken a side-quest and started working on a problem I've had as a parent.

I noticed that it's difficult to find child-care centers in Vancouver. Some issues:
* There's a general lack of information online via search
* Some centers don't have websites and aren't even on Google Maps 📍
* Fraser Health's website is hard to navigate

So I've been developing a web app to find day-care centers around Vancouver. 

Unfortunately progress has been slow with daddy duties and a short fight with the cold. But I'm hopeful to deploy an MVP soon! 🤞


# Updates 📘
* Started working on project to easily find daycares near you
    * _Targetting an initial release next month for feedback_

# Lessons 📝
* I read _Four-Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals_ ⏱️  and recommend it for anyone who:
    1. Constantly feels there's not enough time in a day, or
    2. Keeps procrastinating and aren't sure what to do with their time
* Main takeways for me were:
    * The universe [does not care what you do with your time](https://tim.blog/2021/12/15/the-liberation-of-cosmic-insignificance-therapy/). So stop over-analyzing and start
    * You are always settling. Make an irreversible choice instead of _"keeping your options open"_
    * Reconsider cramming your days. Accept that you cannot do everything. Prioritize what is important.

# On My Mind 💡
I don't have much to show for this month in terms of projects, but am trying to remember that slow and steady progress leads the way. 🐢
