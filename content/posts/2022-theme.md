# What is a Theme?
If you don't know what a theme is, I recommend you watch [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE)

Basically, the TLDR is that instead of New Year's resolutions, a theme is an aspect that you want to focus on for the year. It can be flexibile and adapt to your situation throughout the year, but provides a central idea to nudge yourself towards.

My theme for 2022 is **Exploration**

# Exploration ü§†

In the last couple of months, I had two significant changes in my life:
1. I had a daughter üë∂
2. I quit my corporate job to take a work sabbatical and became a stay-at-home dad

I picked the exploration theme because I want to try a bunch of things now that I have more time in this new lifestyle.

## Goals
My initial goals in no particular order for this year:
* **Explore Family:** Be present while my daughter's growing up
* **Explore Business:** A [laser-cutting service](https://www.charreddesigns.ca)
* **Explore Community:** Daddy and Me group for a community of dads focussed on family
* **Explore Creatively:** Self-publish an escape-room book
* **Explore Passion:** Hone my teaching skills through blogging and video tutorials
* **Explore Literally:** At least one east-coast Canada trip and one international trip

*PS: Travelling depends on state of the world* ü§∑

That's a lot to bite, and some may fall through the cracks. But it's fun to think about and I believe I can make at least some progress on these items.
