Howdy!

The struggle is real to keep a consistent schedule. I'm trying to carve out time for different areas of life but baby takes up almost the whole pie each day *(as expected)*. But I'm still chugging along in the background for other things. 😊

Currently having mild success by working on personal goals for at least 30 minutes a day. ⏰

If you're not where you want to be in certain projects, remember that it all takes time. A quote from Bill Gates:

> We overestimate what we can do in a day but underestimate what we can do in a decade

I was a completely different person 10 years ago.

Who were you a decade ago? What are you doing now?

# Updates 📘
* Finally completed the [BC Daycare Map](https://www.bcdaycare.ca)! 🥳
  * Why spend 2 days calling daycare centers to register for a waitlist when you can spend 2 months coding up a tool in order to spend 2 days calling daycare centers? Ah...
  * Anyways, this tool helped us find daycenters near us. Hope it helps other families too! (*Note: only works for the Fraser Health region atm*)
* Opened up an Etsy shop for [Charred Designs](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/charreddesignsca)! 🏪
  * We can accept actual money!
* Made a Klingon Star Trek clock for a dear friend 🖖
  * Was a fun project to design

# Lessons 📝
* Opening a shop in Facebook/Instagram is not as easy as it seems
  * I had an error message when creating a shop telling me to increase my presence on Instagram
  > Your Facebook account and Page or Instagram professional account must have demonstrated trustworthiness, including through an authentic, established presence. This may also include maintaining a sufficient follower base.
  * It seemed like I needed to post more or have more followers/engagement, but there was no clear signal on what the threshold was
  * Thankfully a workaround for me was using mobile for the initial shop setup (it wasn't working on Desktop)
* I need to work on marketing/spreading what I've created much more than just building the tool
  * Tool is not useful if no one knows about it 🙂
* BC has a program called [StrongStart](https://www.vsb.bc.ca/Student_Learning/Early-Learners/StrongStart/Pages/default.aspx) where kids can free-play and parents can meet each other
  * Community centers may also have Family Enrichment Centres where kids can roam around
  * Been taking baby to them recently and she's having a blast

# On My Mind 💡
* Just watched **Everything Everywhere All at Once**
  * Such a wacky multiverse movie, so funny but tied together by an emotional family drama
  * Definitely recommend, 10/10 🦝

# Asks 🙇
