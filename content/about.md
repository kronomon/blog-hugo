### Hi, I'm Lamont. Nice to meet you! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Thank you for stopping by!

# Who am I?
I'm a software engineer specializing in DevOps based in beautiful Vancouver, BC. 🍁

3 things I strive to be:
* __Problem Solver__ - I'm excited to help people achieve their goals and solve complex problems
* __Educator__ - I have a coaching leadership style and am passionate about empowering others to reach their potential. I love to educate and inspire others to learn
* __Listener__ - I don't think there are enough listeners in the world. We must listen to be understood

In my free time, I can be found venturing in the local mountains ⛰️ or exploring a local café ☕. If you want to chat, I can be bribed with korean fried chicken 🍗
