# BC Daycare Locater Map üë∂üó∫Ô∏è

### Overview
When we were searching for childcare facilities for our daughter, we found the process a bit difficult to navigate. I created a webapp to map licensed childcare facilities for parents in the Fraser Health region of BC.

It has an intuitive interface and parents can quickly see licensed daycares near them and check Fraser Health's inspection reports. The data is pulled from the [Fraser Health Childcare database](https://www.healthspace.ca/Clients/FHA/FHA_Website.nsf/CCFL-Child)

# Yahoo Fantasy Hockey Assistant üèí

### Overview
I play in a weekly head-to-head categories hockey league on Yahoo Sports. I used to manually calculate expected production from my players to optimize matchups which was cumbersome.

I created a Chrome Extension that automates predictions based on a player's per-game stats and the number of games they have during the week within the Yahoo website. This project was interesting as I worked mainly with backend.
